# Overarching goal
_*Investigate forest cover change across protected areas.*_


# Challenge aims
- Map forest cover change from the Hansen et al. Database for your group's protected area as well for the larger region surrounding the protected area
- Create a figure in R visualising the amounts of forest cover change over time
- Report the state of forests in your group's protected area in a Markdown document

# Title

Forest cover change in Białowieża National Park


# Authors

# Research question
__How much forest cover loss and gain has occurred in Białowieża National Park?__


# Introduction

_*Introduce the reader to your park and research questions that you are testing during this challenge in 200 words or fewer. You can include a few references if you would like.*_


The National Park is situated in the north-east part of Poland, in podlaskie voivodeship. The Park covers the central part of Białowieża Forest. The Park covers the area of 10 517,27 ha, which constitutes 1/6 of the Polish part of Białowieża Forest. 6059,27 ha is under strict protection, 4104,63 ha is under active protection, and landscape protection covers the area of 353,37 ha. 

There has been a protection zone created around the Park which covers the state commercial forest having an area of 3224,26 ha. This national reserve is exhibiting a major problem in capony reduction, with 26% of the entire Polish part of BF has been logged. This will have a serious impact on the natural dynamics in this area, making it crucial to employ conservation efforts.

This report will discuss how much forest cover loss and gain has occurred in Białowieża National Park through mapping simulations on Googloe Earth Engine. This allows us to have a clear view of the change in forest canopy cover, allowing conservation efforts to be planned and implimented.

# Workflow

_*Write out or draw your workflow in text here, on paper or in a ppt slide and then take a photo of that to include.*_


# Specific hypotheses and predictions

_*What do you know about this protected area?  What sort of factors could influence forest cover change in this part of the world?*_

Significant logging in 2017 due to the spruce dark beetle attacking the Norway spruce trees has had a detrimental effect on the forest cover in the national park. Norway spruce trees are also very sensitive to drought, which is becoming more prevalent due to climate change. We expect the pressure of drought to be increasingly weakening the forest canopy, in turn reducing the forest cover in the national park. 


# Methods

_*Describe your methods in brief including all of the datasets that you used with appropriate crediting/referencing/copyright for the datasets.*_


# Data vis and summary methods

_*Describe your data visualisation, any mathematical summaries and/or any statistical methods that you used in brief. Include any relevant R code snippets.*_

```r
Your code
```

# 1. Maps of forest cover change for your protected area

_*Describe your results using appropriate scientific writing. Include maps of your protected area with informative captions.*_

_*Your maps*_


# 2. Visualisation of the amount of forest cover loss and gain for your protected area

# 3. How do your results compare with your predictions? What do you think might explain the patterns you found?

_*Use your scientific and critical thinking skills to provide a conclusion summary statement of how land cover is changing across the protected area that you studied.*_

__*Your text and/or figures.*__


# 4. What other datasets, available within the GEE, could you use to test the potential drivers of forest cover change in your group's protected area that you identified in point #3. ?

_*Browse through the GEE Data catalogue and provide a link to your chosen dataset with a brief statement about why you chose it. Note you don't need to do analyses with this new dataset, you are just making a suggestion for future studies.*_

__*Link and description of your chosen dataset*__

_*BONUS! If you have the time, for some bonus recognition, map your chosen dataset in the GEE and include a visualisation of the dataset for your protected area (screencap from GEE).*_


# 5. What research question and hypotheses would you test with those additional datasets in your proposed future research and why does that research matter for the park management?

_*Add your answer here.*_


# Conclusions

_*Summarise what you have found in this challenge and its broader implications.*_
